# Notes on Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

In this LaTeX project I collected all the materials I stuedied during the last years on the topic of data structures and algorithms. The main source of these notes is the Udacity online coruse [Intro to Data Sturctures and Algoritms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513), in which I added also materials from books, webpages, and YouTube educational videos.

These notes are just a personal attempt to collect in only one place all the most important things of this huge area of computer science.
