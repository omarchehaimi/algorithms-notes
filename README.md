# Notes on Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

In this LaTeX project I collected all the materials I studied during the last years on the topic of data structures and algorithms. The main sources are the Udacity online course [Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513), and the book of M.T. Goodrich, R. Tamassia, and M.H. Goldwasser, *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* (John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 2013). I also added some additional materials from webpages, and YouTube educational videos.

These notes are not intended to be a book, nor a formal introduction to
data structures and algorithms, they are just my personal attempt to have a
small, yet comprehensive notes about the huge world on this topic.



The notes were written in LaTeX by using the `classicthesis` typographical look ([ClassicThesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis)).

# Compilation

The LaTeX code was compiled using PDFLaTeX ([PDFLaTeX](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/)), and for the bibliography with BibLaTeX ([BibLaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex)). The IDE used was Texmaker ([TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)).
