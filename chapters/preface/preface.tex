The following notes are based on the Udacity online course \href{https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513}{Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms}. These notes are not to intended to be as book, nor a formal introduction to data structures and algorithms, they are just a my personal attempt to have a small but comprehensive notes about the huge world of data structures and algorithms.
