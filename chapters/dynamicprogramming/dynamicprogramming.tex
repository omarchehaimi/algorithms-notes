\chapter{Dynamic Programming}
\label{chp:dynamicprogramming}
In this chapter are introduced the fundamentals concepts of \textbf{dynamic programming}.
 
\section{General Definitions}
Dynamic programming is a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method \cite{wikidynamicprogramming} (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming}{Dynamic Programming, Wikipedia}).

In computer science a problem can be solved with a dynamic programming method must have an optimal substructure (the problem can be broken down in smaller parts) and an overlapping sub-problems (the broken down problems share some results). If a problem can be solved with an optimal substructure but with non-overlapping sub-problems then the strategy is called \textbf{divide and conquer}.
