\chapter{Graphs}
\label{chp:graphs}
In this chapter are introduced the fundamental concepts of \textbf{graph} as a mathematical object and as an abstract data type, its applications to computer science, and the most important and notable algorithms with their implementations. 
 
\section{General Definitions}
A graph is a discrete mathematical structure in which the connections between its elements and their relationship are highlighted. A graph is made up by two different elements: \textbf{nodes} or \textbf{vertices}, and \textbf{links} or \textbf{edges}. In case the links do not have any direction the graph is called \textbf{undirected graph} (Figure \ref{undirect_a}), in case, instead, the links have a direction the graph is called \textbf{directed graph} (Figure \ref{direct_b}).

Formally a graph is the pair \(G=(V, E)\), where \(V\) is the set of all vertices, and \(E\) is the set of paired vertices, whose elements are called edges \cite{wikigraphmath}.

A \textbf{tree} (Chapter \ref{chp:trees}) is a special kind of graph.

Graphs are very useful to describe a lot of real situations like: connections between people, computers (internet), web pages (world wide web), airports, cities, and gene inside the DNA.

In graphs, unlike trees, closed loops can exist. These kind of closed loops can be dangerous for the algorithms since they could lead to infinite executions.

\subsection{Connectivity}
\textbf{Connectivity} is a measure that describes how much the nodes of a graph are connected. It is defined as the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to separate the remaining nodes into isolated subgraphs \cite{wikiconnectivity}.

A graph is said to be \textbf{connected} if every pair of nodes are connected. Thus it always exists at least one path that connects every pair of nodes. If an undirected graph is not connected then it is \textbf{disconnected}: in this case there is one or more nodes that can not be reached by any paths.

\paragraph{Strongly Connected}
A directed graph is said to be \textbf{strongly connected} if every pair of nodes can be reached by one or more path.

\paragraph{Weakly Connected}
A directed graph is said to be \textbf{weakly connected} if, by replacing all the directed edges with undirectd ones, the new graph is connected. In a directed graph some nodes can not be reached if all the edges exit or enter from them. The graph in Figure \ref{graphs_2} is weakly connected since the node \(g\) has only entering edges.

\section{Graph Representations}
There are several ways to represent graphs using data structures. For example in an object oriented programming language a way could be to define a type for the vertex, and a type for the edges.

The most common data structures used for representing a graph are: \textbf{edge list}, \textbf{adjacency list}, and \textbf{adjacency matrix} \cite{goodrich2013data}. 

In appendix \ref{complexityappendix} there is a summary of the complexities for the most common operations performed on graphs for the different data structures.

\subsection{Edge List}
The \textbf{edge list} is an unordered list of all the pairs of nodes that form an edge. This representation is minimal but it does not allow to locate a specific edge, or the set of edges incident to a particular node \cite{goodrich2013data}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture} [node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}, >=stealth]  
  
  \node[main] (na) at (-2,0) {$a$};
  \node[main] (nb) at (0,0) {$b$};
  \node[main] (nc) at (-1,-1) {$c$};
  \node[main] (nd) at (-2.2,-2.2) {$d$};
  \node[main] (ne) at (-3,-1) {$e$};
  
  \draw (na) -- (nb);
  \draw (na) -- (nc);
  \draw (na) -- (ne);
  \draw (nb) -- (nc);
  \draw (nc) -- (nd);
  
  \draw ($(nc) + (4,-0.2)$) node[align=left] (l) {$[[a, b], [a, c], [a, e], [b, c], [c, d]]$};
    
\end{tikzpicture}  
\caption[Edge list.]{Edge list.}
\label{graphs_3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adjacency List}
The \textbf{adjacency list} is a list containing a separate list for each node containing all the incident edges to that node. In this representation identify all the edges incident to a node is easy \cite{goodrich2013data}. In case of directed graphs for each node there are two different lists: one for the entering edges, and another one for the outgoing ones.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture} [node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}, >=stealth]  
  
  \node[main] (na) at (-2,0) {$a$};
  \node[main] (nb) at (0,0) {$b$};
  \node[main] (nc) at (-1,-1) {$c$};
  \node[main] (nd) at (-2.2,-2.2) {$d$};
  \node[main] (ne) at (-3,-1) {$e$};
  
  \draw (na) -- (nb);
  \draw (na) -- (nc);
  \draw (na) -- (ne);
  \draw (nb) -- (nc);
  \draw (nc) -- (nd);
  
  \draw ($(nc) + (4,-0.2)$) node[align=left] (l) {
  	$[\textcolor{BrickRed}{\overbrace{\textcolor{black}{[b, c, e]}}^{a}}, 
  	  \textcolor{BrickRed}{\overbrace{\textcolor{black}{[a, c]}}^{b}}, 
  	  \textcolor{BrickRed}{\overbrace{\textcolor{black}{[a, b, d]}}^{c}}, 
  	  \textcolor{BrickRed}{\overbrace{\textcolor{black}{[c]}}^{d}}, 
  	  \textcolor{BrickRed}{\overbrace{\textcolor{black}{[a]}}^{e}}]$};
    
\end{tikzpicture}  
\caption[Adjacency list.]{Adjacency list.}
\label{graphs_4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
The \textbf{adjacency matrix} is a matrix \(A\) in which each element \(A[i, j]\) represents the relationship between the edge \(i\) with the edge \(j\). If between \(i\) and \(j\) there is an edge \(A[i, j] = 1\), otherwise \(0\). In case an edge go out and enter in the same node \(A[i, i] = 1\). For undirected graphs this matrix is symmetric, and in case there are not edges going in and out the same node the principal diagonal is all of \(0\).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture} [node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}, >=stealth]  
  
  \node[main] (na) at (-2,0) {$a$};
  \node[main] (nb) at (0,0) {$b$};
  \node[main] (nc) at (-1,-1) {$c$};
  \node[main] (nd) at (-2.2,-2.2) {$d$};
  \node[main] (ne) at (-3,-1) {$e$};
  
  \draw (na) -- (nb);
  \draw (na) -- (nc);
  \draw (na) -- (ne);
  \draw (nb) -- (nc);
  \draw (nc) -- (nd);
  
  \draw ($(nc) + (3,-0.2)$) node[align=left] (l) {
  	  $\: \: \: \: \: \textcolor{BrickRed}{a} \: \: \textcolor{BrickRed}{b} \: \: \textcolor{BrickRed}{c} \: \: \textcolor{BrickRed}{d} \: \: \textcolor{BrickRed}{e} $ \\
      $\textcolor{BrickRed}{a}[[0, 1, 1, 0, 1],$ \\
      $\textcolor{BrickRed}{b}\: \: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],$ \\
      $\textcolor{BrickRed}{c}\: \: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],$ \\
      $\textcolor{BrickRed}{d}\: \: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],$ \\
      $\textcolor{BrickRed}{e}\: \: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]$
   };
    
\end{tikzpicture}  
\caption[Adjacency matrix.]{Adjacency matrix.}
\label{graphs_5}
\end{figure}

In appendix \ref{graphimplementationappendix} there is the full Python implementation of the graph representations. There are defined the classes for nodes, edges, and graphs objects. Moreover, all the main operations on graphs like: insert a new node, a new edge, get the edge list, the adjacency list, the adjacency matrix, and find the max index are also implemented.

\section{Graph Traversal}
As for trees (Chapter \ref{chp:trees}), also for graphs there are two different ways of traversal: the \textbf{depth-first search}, and the \textbf{breadth-first search}. But for graphs, differently from trees, there is not a privileged way to traverse, and it is arbitrarily chosen a node where to start.

\subsection{Depth-first Search (DFS)}
In the \textbf{depth-fist search} the search starts from an arbitrary node, and traverse one of the connected node. This process is repeated until there are not any new nodes on that path, and starts again with a new node, until the node we are looking for is found or all the nodes have been traversed \cite{wikidepthfirst}. This traversal can be implemented both recursively, and iteratively by using a stack.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture} [node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}]  
  
  \node[main] (na) at (0,0) {$a$};
  \node[main] (nb) at (2,0) {$b$};
  \node[main] (nc) at (2,-2) {$c$};
  \node[main] (nd) at (0,-2) {$d$};
  \node[main] (ne) at (-2,-1.8) {$e$};
  
  \draw (na) -- (nb);
  \draw (na) -- (nc);
  \draw (na) -- (nd);
  \draw (nd) -- (nc);
  \draw (nd) -- (ne);
  
  \draw[->, >=stealth, BrickRed] ($(na) + (-0.7,0.7)$) -- (na);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (na.west) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, xshift=-4pt] {1} (nd.north west);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (nd.north west) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, yshift=4pt] {2} (ne.north east);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (ne.south east) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, yshift=-5pt] {} (nd.south west);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (nd.south east) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, yshift=-5pt] {3} (nc.south west);
  \path[BrickRed] (nc.north) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, xshift=4pt, yshift=4pt] {4} (na.south east);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (na.south east) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, yshift=4pt] {} (nb.south west);
  
  \draw ($(nd) + (-0.5,-1)$) node[align=left] {a, d, e, c, b};
      
\end{tikzpicture}  
\caption[Depth-first search example.]{Depth-first search example.}
\label{graphs_6}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=1, caption={Recursive implementation of a depth-first search.}]
class Graph():
	...
	
	def depth_first_search_recursive(self, start_node):
		ret_list = [start_node.value]
		start_node.visited = True
		edges_out = [e for e in start_node.edges
					 if e.node_to.value != start_node.value]
		for e in edges_out:
			if not edge.node_to.visited:
				ret_list.extend(depth_first_search_recursive(edge.node_to)
		return ret_list
\end{lstlisting}

The complexity in this case is \(O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) the number of vertexes. For more details on the complexities evaluation on graphs refer here \cite{goodrich2013data}.

In appendix \ref{graphimplementationtraversalappendix} there is a detailed recursive and iterative implementation, with also an additional example.
\subsection{Breadth-first Search (BFS)}
In the \textbf{breadth-first search} the traversal is done by starting from a node, and the first visited nodes are all its neighbors. Once visited all the neighbors the traversal keeps going in the same previous way, looking to all the node's neighbors first.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture} [node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}]  
  
  \node[main] (na) at (0,0) {$a$};
  \node[main] (nb) at (2,0) {$b$};
  \node[main] (nc) at (2,-2) {$c$};
  \node[main] (nd) at (0,-2) {$d$};
  \node[main] (ne) at (-2,-1.8) {$e$};
  
  \draw (na) -- (nb);
  \draw (na) -- (nc);
  \draw (na) -- (nd);
  \draw (nd) -- (nc);
  \draw (nd) -- (ne);
  
  \draw[->, >=stealth, BrickRed] ($(na) + (-0.7,0.7)$) -- (na);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (na.west) edge [bend right=20] node[draw=none, xshift=-4pt] {1} (nd.north west);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (na.south) edge [bend right=30] node[draw=none, xshift=-4pt, yshift=-4pt] {2} (nc.north west);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (na.north east) edge [bend left=20] node[draw=none, yshift=5pt] {3} (nb.north west);
  \path[->, BrickRed, >=stealth] (nd.south west) edge [bend left=20] node[draw=none, yshift=-5pt] {4} (ne.south east);
  
  \draw ($(nd) + (-0.5,-1)$) node[align=left] {a, d, c, b, e};
      
\end{tikzpicture}  
\caption[Breadth-first search example.]{Breadth-first search example.}
\label{graphs_7}
\end{figure}

The only possible implementation is the iterative one, and it is implemented by using a queue.

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=1, caption={Recursive implementation of a depth-first search.}]
class Graph():
	...
	
	def breadth_first_search(self, start_node):
  		queue = []
		queue.append(start_node)
  		while queue:
    		q = queue.pop(0)
    		edges_out = [e for e q.edges if e.node_to.value != q.value]
    		for neighbour in edges_out:
      			if neighbour not neighbour.visited:
        			neighbour.visited = True
        			queue.append(neighbour)
\end{lstlisting}

The complexity in this case is \(O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) the number of vertexes. For more details on the complexities evaluation on graphs refer here \cite{goodrich2013data}.

\paragraph{Spanning Tree}
Using a tree it is possible to visualize how the graph is traversed. For the graph in Figure \ref{graphs_7} the spanning tree is the following.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={circle,draw,minimum size=8mm}, node distance=15mm, thick]

\node {$a$}
   child{node {$b$}
             child {node {$e$}}
        }
   child{node {$c$}}
   child{node {$d$}};
      
\end{tikzpicture}  
\caption[Spanning tree.]{Spanning tree.}
\label{graphs_spanning_tree}
\end{figure}

In appendix \ref{graphimplementationtraversalappendix} there is the detailed implementation, with also an additional example.
\subsection{Eulerian Path and Circuit}
An \textbf{Eulerian path} (or \textbf{Eulerian trail}) is a path of edges that visits all the edges in a graph exactly once \cite{wikieulerianpathcircuit}. Not every graph has an Eulerian path and even if a graph has an Eulerian path it could be found only at specific starting nodes (Figure \ref{graphs_8}).

An \textbf{Eulerian circuit} (or \textbf{Eulerian cycle}) is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same node. As before not every graph has an Eulerian circuit.

\end{table}

\subsection{Hamiltonian Path and Circuit}
A \textbf{Hamiltonian path} (or \textbf{traceable path}) is a path in which all the nodes are visited exactly once. A \textbf{Hamiltonian circuit} (or \textbf{Hamiltonian Cycle}) is a Hamiltonian path that starts and ends in the same node \cite{wikihamiltoninanpathcircuit}.

\subsection{Shortest Path Problem}
The \textbf{shorted path problem} is the problem of finding a path between two nodes such that the sum of the weights is minimized. In case of an undirected graph the shortest path is the path that pass through the minimum number of nodes \cite{wikishortestpath}. The breadth-first search can be used for finding the shortest path from a node to all the others, but it expects that all the edges are of the same nature, and in several situations this approach is not useful. Let us image we would like to find the best path connecting two cities. In this case the links between the nodes are not the same, since some streets are faster or slower than others. Another interesting application of finding the shortest path in graphs, is about routing packages from a computer to another in order to be as fast as possible.

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}
\label{sec:dijkstra}
The Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm for a non-negative weighted graphs, finds all the shortest paths from a given node to all the others. The distance between two nodes is the sum of the weights of the edges of the path \cite{wikidijkstra}.

This algorithm is part of a broader class of algorithms which are called \textbf{greedy algorithms}. In the greedy algorithms the optimal solution is found by finding the optimal solution at every step without considering the previous ones. Anyway, this approach does not always find the optimal solution of a problem. A more advanced technique to greedy algorithm is \textbf{dynamic programming}, which will be the topic of the next chapter.

\paragraph{Relaxation}
Before introducing the Dijkstra's algorithm it is important to introduce the \textbf{relaxation condition}. Let us consider the weighted directed graph of Figure \ref{graphs_12}. The cost for going from node \(a\) to node \(u\) is \(2\), and \(\infty\) from \(a\) to \(v\), since there is not any direct link between that nodes. The relaxation condition is then:

\begin{definition}[Relaxation condition]
\enspace \enspace \textnormal{if (d[u] + w(u, v) < d[v])}

\enspace \enspace \enspace     \textnormal{d[v] = d[u] + w(u, v)}

Where \(d[u]\) is the distance of node u from the starting node (\(1\) in this case), and \(w(u, v)\) is the weight from the node \(u\) to node \(v\).
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]

\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}]

		\node[main] (na) at (0,0) {a};
  		\node[main] (nu) at (2,0) {u};
  		\node[main] (nv) at (4,0) {v};
  		
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (na) edge node[draw=none, yshift=6pt] {$2$} (nu);
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (nu) edge node[draw=none, yshift=6pt] {$4$} (nv);
  		
  		\draw ($(nu) + (0, -7mm)$) node[draw, rectangle] {$2$};
  		\draw ($(nv) + (0, -7mm)$) node[draw, rectangle] (inf) {$\infty$};
  		
  		\draw ($(nu) + (1, -1.2)$) node[draw=none, rectangle] {$2+4<\infty$};
  		
  		\draw ($(nv) + (0, -1.8)$) node[draw, rectangle] (nup) {$6$};
  		
  		\path[->, >=stealth] (inf.east) edge [bend left=20] node[draw=none, xshift=-4pt] {} (nup.east);

\end{tikzpicture}

\caption[Relaxation condition.]{Relaxation condition.}
\label{graphs_12}
\end{figure}

In other words the relaxation condition says that if there is a shorter path connecting two nodes, this distance should be used as the new distance.

In the Dijkstra's algorithm at each step the new node is chosen based on the lowest value of the distance at that given step, and eventually the distances for all the adjacent nodes are updated accordingly the relaxation condition.

Let us consider the graph in Figure \ref{graphs_13}, and let us start from the node \(a\) \cite{dijkstraexplaination}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={15mm}, thick, main/.style = {draw, circle, minimum size=8mm}]

		\node[main] (na) at (0,0) {a};
		\node[main] (nb) at (3,0) {b};
		\node[main] (nc) at (5,0) {c};
		\node[main] (nd) at (0,-3) {d};
		\node[main] (ne) at (3,-3) {e};
		\node[main] (nf) at (5,-3) {f};
		
		\node[draw=none] (start) at ($(na) + (-1,1)$) {Start};
  		
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (start) -- (na);
  		
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (na) edge node[draw=none, yshift=6pt] {50} (nb);
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (nb) edge node[draw=none, yshift=6pt] {10} (nc);
  		\path[->, >=stealth] (na.north) edge [bend left=20] node[draw=none, yshift=6pt] {45} (nc.north);
  		\path[->, >=stealth] (na.south west) edge node[draw=none, xshift=-7pt] {10} (nd.north west);
  		\path[->, >=stealth] (nd.north east) edge node[draw=none, xshift=-7pt] {} (na.south east);
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (nd) edge node[draw=none, yshift=-6pt] {15} (ne);
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (ne) edge node[draw=none, xshift=-7pt] {20} (nb);
  		\draw[->, >=stealth] (nf) edge node[draw=none, yshift=-6pt] {3} (ne);
  		\path[->, >=stealth] (nc.south) edge [bend left=50] node[draw=none, xshift=12pt, yshift=8pt] {35} (ne.north east);
  		\path[->, >=stealth] (ne.north east) edge [bend left=50] node[draw=none, yshift=10pt] {30} (nc.south west);

\end{tikzpicture}

\caption[Dijkstra's algorithms example.]{Dijkstra's algorithm example.}
\label{graphs_13}
\end{figure}

For describing how the algorithm works we use the following table, in which for each column there is a node, and at every step a new row is added for the node for which the shortest path has just been found. At the first step the table looks like:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c}
    explored vertex & a & b & c & d & e & f \\
    \hline
    a & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{0_{a}} & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \(10_{a}\) & \(\infty\) & \(\infty\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All the nodes are listed as columns, and all the distances from the node \(a\) to all the others are reported in the table. The nodes \(e\) and \(f\) do not have any directed link to the node \(a\), then their distance is infinity. Once listed all the distances the node with the lowest one is selected: at the first step it is the node \(a\).

At the second step the lowest distance is chosen: in this case it is for the node \(d\), then it is added in the visited node as the shortest path from \(a\) to \(d\) is fund. The node \(e\) is now reachable and it has a distance of \(15\) from \(d\), then \(25\) from \(a\) (\(10_{a}+15_{b, e}\)).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c}
    visited node & a & b & c & d & e & f \\
    \hline
    a & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{0_{a}} & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \(10_{a}\) & \(\infty\) & \(\infty\) \\

    d & | & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{10_{a}} & \(25_{d}\) & \(\infty\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The process is repeated again: the lowest distance is chosen, in this case is the distance to reach the node \(e\). As for the previous step we check for all nodes if it is shorter to pass through the new shortest path found, and in case true the weight are updated (relaxation condition). At this step the weight to be updated is the one for the node \(b\) because for reaching it from \(a\) the weight is \(50\) (\(50_{a}\)), while for reaching it passing through \(e\) (which in turn for be reached with its shortest path we have to go through \(d\), which in turn again is reached with its shortest path from \(a\)) is \(45\) (\(25_{d} + 20_{e, b}=45_{e}< 50_{a}\)).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c}
    visited node & a & b & c & d & e & f \\
    \hline
    a & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{0_{a}} & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \(10_{a}\) & \(\infty\) & \(\infty\) \\

    d & | & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{10_{a}} & \(25_{d}\) & \(\infty\) \\
    
    e & | & \(45_{e}\) & \(45_{a}\) & | & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{25_{d}} & \(\infty\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The same process is repeated again, the new shortest path found is tor the node \(b\) passing through \(e\) with a weight of \(45\). In this case there are two shortest path, and for this example is the same choosing one of them.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c}
    visited node & a & b & c & d & e & f \\
    \hline
    a & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{0_{a}} & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \(10_{a}\) & \(\infty\) & \(\infty\) \\

    d & | & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{10_{a}} & \(25_{d}\) & \(\infty\) \\
    
    e & | & \(45_{e}\) & \(45_{a}\) & | & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{25_{d}} & \(\infty\) \\
    
    b & | & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{45_{e}} & \(45_{a}\) & | & | & \(\infty\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the last step all the shortest paths are found. Only the node \(f\) has been left out since it can not be reached in any ways from \(a\).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c}
    visited node & a & b & c & d & e & f \\
    \hline
    a & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{0_{a}} & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \(10_{a}\) & \(\infty\) & \(\infty\) \\

    d & | & \(50_{a}\) & \(45_{a}\) & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{10_{a}} & \(25_{d}\) & \(\infty\) \\
    
    e & | & \(45_{e}\) & \(45_{a}\) & | & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{25_{d}} & \(\infty\) \\
    
    b & | & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{45_{e}} & \(45_{a}\) & | & | & \(\infty\) \\
    
    d & | & | & \mybox[rounded corners=6pt, line width=1pt, draw=black, fill=green!25]{mycol}{45_{e}} & | & | & \(\infty\)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All the shortest paths from \(a\) are:
\begin{itemize}
\item b: a \(\rightarrow\) d \(\rightarrow\) e \(\rightarrow\) b, W=45;
\item c: a \(\rightarrow\) c, W=45;
\item d: a \(\rightarrow\) d, W=10;
\item e: a \(\rightarrow\) d \(\rightarrow\) e, W=25;
\item f: \(\infty\).
\end{itemize}

For example for finding the shortest path for reaching the node \(b\) the steps to follow are:

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c c c}

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{table}

In appendix \ref{dijkstraimplementation} the full implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm is reported. 

The complexity of this algorithm is \(O(\vert V^{2} \vert)\) where \(V\) is the number of nodes. This is because all the nodes are relaxed with respect all the others, and in the worst case all nodes must be checked. If the implementation of the algorithm is optimized the complexity in this case is \(O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert log(\vert V \vert))\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
