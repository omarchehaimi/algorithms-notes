The following notes are based on the Udacity online course \href{https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513}{Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms in Python}, and on M.T. Goodrich, R. Tamassia, and M.H. Goldwasser. Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. John Wiley \& Sons, Incorporated, 2013 text book. These notes are not intended to be a book, nor a formal introduction to data structures and algorithms, they are just my personal attempt to have a small, yet comprehensive notes about the huge world on this topic.
