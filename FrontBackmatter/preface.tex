In these notes I collected all the material I studied during the last years on the topic of data structures and algorithms. The main sources are the Udacity online course \href{https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513}{Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms in Python}, and the book of M.T. Goodrich, R. Tamassia, and M.H. Goldwasser, \textit{Data Structures and Algorithms in Python} (John Wiley \& Sons, Incorporated, 2013). I also used some additional material from webpages and YouTube educational videos.

These notes are not intended to be a book, nor a formal introduction to data structures and algorithms, they are just my personal attempt to have concise notes of the huge world on this topic.
